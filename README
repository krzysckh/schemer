schemer - wrapper around raylib and chibi-scheme that brings back the fun of
game dev (and gui stuff).

dependencies:
  - raylib
  - GNU make

main idea:

create a new schemer project:
  $ schemer init

run debug version:
  $ schemer run

build an executable of the game:
  $ schemer build

schemer project tree (created by schemer init):
- project-name
  - make.scm
  - scm/
    - init.scm
    - ... ; .scm files
  - res/
    - ... ; resources etc.
  - build/
    - ... ; build files (auto-generated)
